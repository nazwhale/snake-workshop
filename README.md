# üêç Snake workshop

### Vibes!

1. The idea is for everyone to have something to show off and play with
2. That means no-one will be left behind
3. The way we're not going to leave people behind is that everyone's going to be unblocking each other in Slack. If you're stuck, post a sentence or a screenshot and everyone else will help to unblock you. The aim of this is to try to get everyone to be self-sufficient.
4. We'll gloss over some things and generalise a bit. Some of the code could be neatened up with some clever tricks, but we'll leave those alone for now. This might feel a bit frustrating for some, but it's just too overwhelming to try and learn everything all at once. For now we'll have to let some magic be magic and focus on the essentials ‚ú®

### Stuff we'll encounter!

1. Getting setup for coding
2. The terminal
3. Coding for the web
4. Essential Javascript
5. Variables
6. Functions
7. If statements
8. Classes
9. Arrays (referencing indexes; pushing, shifting)
10. Loops
11. p5.js (a creative coding library)
12. The developer tools in Google Chrome
13. Unblocking yourself
14. Unblocking others
15. Reading errors
16. Seeing me mess up loads

### Setup!

1. Make a coding folder with a snake folder in it from the command line
2. Download Atom
3. Get prettier
4. Download empty snake template (with p5.js) and open it on localhost

### A Blob!

1. Explain what snake is
2. Explain how p5 draws stuff and it's draw and update functions
3. Make a blob
4. Move it around

### Apples!

1. Make apples pop up
2. Eat the apple

### A Snake!

1. Grow the snakes body when it eats an apple

### Death!

1. Make the snake die when it hits a wall
2. Make the snake die when it hits itself

### Ideas for after!

- Show the score
- Make everything all nice and pastel coloured. Go nuts with styling.
- Ensure the apple doesn't pop up on a square where the snake's already at.
- Add a box on the web page so that you can control the speed without changing the code.
- Snake 2 (go through walls).
- Translate your code into Python for extra snake points üêçüêçüêç
- Import an image of a real apple.
- Deploy it to the web with it's own domain name
- Train a machine learning algorithm to play snake ü§ñ
- Pay it forward - teach this workshop to someone else!
